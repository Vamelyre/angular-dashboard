# Angular Dashboard

A responsive Angular 19 dashboard app built for the crocobet interview stage 1. (frontend architecture, routing, API integration, and UI design) 

The app displays Users, Posts, Todos, and includes a Promotions page with a spinning wheel and leaderboard.

(in georgian)

(tried my best with the spinning wheel however the labels are a little messed up. I would normally use a library for something like this but the only available one wasn't compatible with the version of angular I was meant to use)
